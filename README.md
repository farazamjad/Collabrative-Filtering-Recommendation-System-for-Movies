## Features

- User-based collaborative filtering: The system recommends movies to users based on the preferences and behaviors of similar users.
- Item-based collaborative filtering: The system recommends movies to users based on the similarity between movies and their preferences.
- Matrix factorization: The system applies matrix factorization techniques to decompose the user-movie rating matrix and provide recommendations.
